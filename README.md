# RegionFocus-Implementation
A Python implementation of the RegionFocus research paper ('Visual Test-time Scaling for GUI Agent Grounding', arXiv:2505.00684). This framework uses visual test-time scaling, dynamically zooming into relevant areas after errors , and an 'image-as-map' landmark system to improve GUI agent grounding accuracy and error recovery.
